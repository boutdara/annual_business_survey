# Annual Business Survey

## Introduction
This repository contains all relevant documents for the Week 8 assessment of the Dev10 Development Program. Group 2 consists of Dan Angelina, Nicole Boutdara, Douglas Byers, and Christopher Cao. The group was tasked to examine and analyze the United States Census Bureau's Annual Business Survey (ABS) APIs using Python and Pandas. We sought to answer the following questions:

- Does the number of employees increase the longer the company exists?
- What are the sizes of companies across the country
- Is a college degree required to start/own a business?
- What is the most common age of business owners?
- How many businesses are female-owned for each level of revenue?
- What percentage of businesses are owned by non-US citizens and those born outside of the United States?
- In which states do employees in black-owned companies earn the most? How does their pay compare to workers in those states overall?
- In which states do employees in veteran-owned companies earn the most? How does their pay compare to workers in those states overall?
- Which business types do employees in black-owned companies earn the most? How does their pay compare to workers in those industries overall? What about veteran-owned companies? 
- What number of businesses do not use certain technologies?
- What number of businesses have certain issues producing cloud based technology?

## Documentation
The repository contains a Jupyter Notebook file that serves as the ETL Report for this project. It demonstrates the steps necessary to extract and transform the API data for analysis. 

In addition to the ETL Report, there is also a PDF file for the Project Report that analyzes the results in further detail. It includes visualizations and discussion of the research process and results as well.
